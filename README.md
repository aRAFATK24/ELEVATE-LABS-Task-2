# ELEVATE-LABS-Task-2

Step 1: Setting Up the Project Structure

First, let's create three files in a new folder:

1. index.html - For our HTML structure
2. style.css - For styling
3. script.js - For functionality

Step 2: HTML Structure

Step 3: Basic Styling

Step 4: JavaScript Functionality

Step 5: Testing the Application

Now you can test the app by:
1. Adding tasks by typing and clicking "Add Task" or pressing Enter
2. Clicking on a task to mark it complete (line-through)
3. Clicking "Delete" to remove tasks

Step 6: Optional Enhancements

If you want to go further, you could add:
- Local storage to persist tasks between page refreshes
- Due dates for tasks
- Task categories or priorities
- Drag and drop to reorder tasks
